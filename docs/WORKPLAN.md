# Workplan

Milestones A/B/C/D with clear done criteria.

## Milestone A: Environment and bring-up
Done means:
- LiteX toolchain installed and verified on Windows
- Digilent Nexys4 DDR supported build target identified
- Basic LiteX bitstream builds without errors
- Board connects and can program bitstream

## Milestone B: CPU baseline
Done means:
- LiteX SoC with VexRiscv runs on hardware
- UART console available at 115200 8-N-1
- CPU-only kernel baseline runs end-to-end
- Baseline outputs and logs captured in results/

## Milestone C: Accelerator integration
Done means:
- Accelerator integrated into LiteX SoC
- SW driver or test harness can exercise accelerator
- Functional correctness verified with tests

## Milestone D: Evaluation and reporting
Done means:
- Baseline vs accelerator results collected
- Performance and resource usage summarized
- Final report and slides ready
